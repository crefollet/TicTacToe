# TicTacToe
  * A small GUI Tic Tac Toe game written in Java using JavaFX.
  * It was completed in a day as a ways to try out GUIs in Java with a newer technology (in classes we used Swing).
  * It's not very polished but it was really made just to try JavaFX out.
  * There is also a downloadable JAR if you want to just run the game.
